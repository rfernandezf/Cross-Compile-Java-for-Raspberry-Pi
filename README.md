# Cross-Compile-Java-for-Raspberry-Pi
## by Rafael Fernández Flores (@Plata17).

Just a simple project for try to cross compile using Gradle a Java proyect using QT and Pi4j on a x86 PC and send it via SSH to the PI, and execute it corectly.

The program creates a new window with QT with a button, when you press it, a led connected to the GPIO port on the Raspberry Pi blinks.

## I Hope it helps to somebody else.
